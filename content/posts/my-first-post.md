## Migration Post

I am retiring the old qualls.me blog platform that I wrote myself.

It was fun at a point in time, but it's just too much complexity to maintain at this point in my life. Not to mention that the front end is AngularJS, which is ancient in tech terms. There are lots of things beyond that that need to be patched or upgraded as well, and I would rather focus on content.

Perhaps I will migrate some of the old content later, but I think I am likely to just forget it and just start over with new content that matches up better with my life right now.
