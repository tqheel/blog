So why is this new site titled “teq 3.0”?

That’s a reasonable question. I’m not sure of the answer myself. 

I think the main thing is that I didn’t want to spend much time thinking about it, and it was the first thing that popped into my head.

The other part of it is that at some point around 2007 or so, I had Tumbler blog and it was titled teq 2.0. At that time I was newly divorced and I liked the thought of “upgrading” who I was as a person. It was a clean start. A do-over. A mulligan.

So now here I am some 15 or so years later, starting over again? No, far from it. Now I’m an older and wiser version of teq 2.0.

Hopefully this won’t be the final version. I think I at least have a few minor versions in me yet.
